# ajaxHackathon

This website needs to be welcomed to the 21st century!

1. Add CSS!
2. Improve the login and registration!
3. Make the comments appear with AJAX so that the page does not refresh!
4. Have the next page of messages appear when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page!
5. Have the search results appear as the form is filled out - no clicking of the submit button necessary!
